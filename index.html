PhotoStamperEasy • Privacy Policy

Effective Date: August 6, 2024

This privacy policy governs your use of the software applications for mobile devices created by [Your Company Name].

Important Privacy Information

To use our app, we may automatically collect the following data from your device: language settings, IP address, time zone, device type and model, device settings, operating system, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, and other unique identifiers (such as IDFA). We need this data to provide our services and analyze how our customers use the app.

To improve the app and attract users, we use third-party solutions. As a result, we may process data using solutions developed by Amplitude, Firebase, Apple, Crashlytics, Apphud, or RevenueCat. Consequently, some of the data is stored and processed on servers of these third parties. This allows us to better understand which features and content are most valuable to our users and to enhance your experience and the quality of our products.

Please read our Privacy Policy below to know more about what we do with data and what data privacy rights are available to you. If you have any questions or would like to exercise your privacy rights, please contact us at develop@snweilai.com.
