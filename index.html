    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 6, 2024</p>
    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software applications for mobile devices created by [Your Company Name].</p>

    <h2>Important Privacy Information</h2>
    <p>To use our app, we may automatically collect the following data from your device: language settings, IP address, time zone, device type and model, device settings, operating system, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, and other unique identifiers (such as IDFA). We need this data to provide our services and analyze how our customers use the app.</p>
    <p>To improve the app and attract users, we use third-party solutions. As a result, we may process data using solutions developed by Amplitude, Firebase, Apple, Crashlytics, Apphud, or RevenueCat.
